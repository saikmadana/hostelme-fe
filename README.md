### System Architecture:

1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: Create a single-page application (SPA) using React for the user interface.
   - **Redux**: Implement Redux for state management to handle data and application state.
   - **Webpack**: Utilize Webpack for bundling assets and managing the build process.
   - **Accessibility**: Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) features to ensure accessibility for all users.
   - **Assets**: Optimize assets, such as images and CSS, for faster page loading.
   - **Multi Language Support**: Implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) for multi-language support.
   - **Offline support**: Make the app a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline access and better performance on mobile devices.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implement Google OAuth for user authentication. You can use libraries like Passport.js to simplify the authentication process.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control. Host your code on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

4. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment process using GitHub Actions.

### Application Modules:

1. **User Management**:
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
   - Integrate Google OAuth for secure authentication.

2. **Tenant Management**:
   - Create, read, update, and delete tenant information.
   - Maintain a list of tenants and their details.

3. **Staff Management**:
   - Create, read, update, and delete staff information.
   - Maintain a list of staff and their details.

4. **Room Management**:
   - Create, read, update, and delete room information.
   - Maintain a list of rooms and their details.

5. **Dashboard**:
   - Display Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for tenants, staff, and rooms.
   - Implement charts and visualizations to present data.

### Data Flow:

1. The frontend React app interacts with the backend server using RESTful API endpoints.

2. Authentication is handled via Google OAuth. Once authenticated, users receive an access token for secured API calls.

3. Users can perform CRUD operations on tenants, staff, and rooms through the frontend.

4. The backend communicates with the chosen database to store and retrieve data.

5. The dashboard component fetches and displays KPIs based on the data stored in the database.

### Security:

- Implement proper security measures to protect user data, including data encryption, authorization checks, and securing API endpoints.

### Scalability:

- Design the system to be easily scalable by allowing the addition of more hostels, rooms, and users.

### Monitoring and Error Handling:

- Set up monitoring and error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to detect and address issues in real-time.

### Testing:

- Implement unit tests, integration tests and e2e tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

### Deployment:

- Use the CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process to staging and production environments.
